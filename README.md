Convnets have been very popular choice for tasks like Image Classification.Here I have used covnet for classification of cifar10 dataset,
which can be easily downloaded via pytorch's torchvision dataset.Although accuracy achieved by it is still nearabout 76% which is quite
low in comparison with current benchmark . But I am hopeful that in future commits I will be able to improve it.
